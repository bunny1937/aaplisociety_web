// Q3 — one society-wide switch: are RESIDENTIAL bills calculated on carpet area
// or built-up area? It is live: change it and the next bill run (and every
// preview) uses the new basis immediately. Bills already generated keep the
// area frozen on them, so history never silently re-prices (Q12).
//
// Shops are deliberately NOT affected. A shop carries its own area on its own
// record, because a shop's billable area is a commercial fact that has nothing
// to do with how the society measures flats.
