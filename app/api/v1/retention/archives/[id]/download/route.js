/**
 * GET /api/retention/archives/:id/download
 *
 * Builds the bundle **now, in memory** and streams it to the browser. Nothing
 * is written to R2, nothing is written to disk, nothing is cached.
 *
 * ## Why on-demand instead of a nightly pre-build
 *
 * At 100 societies, pre-building meant ~36,500 zips a year sitting in a bucket,
 * the overwhelming majority never opened once, while the source data still
 * existed in Mongo anyway (it has not been purged yet — that is the entire
 * point of the two-phase design). You were paying storage to duplicate data you
 * already had, plus upload egress, plus download egress, plus nightly CPU.
 *
 * On demand, the cost is exactly proportional to use: zero for a society that
 * never downloads, one burst of CPU for one that does.
 *
 * ## The download is the consent signal
 *
 * Completing a download flips status to `downloaded` and stamps
 * `downloadedAt`. That stamp is the ONLY thing that makes the purge job
 * eligible to delete the source rows. Not "an email was sent" — that proves
 * nothing about whether a human received anything.
 *
 * Note the ordering below: the bundle is fully built and the sha256 computed
 * BEFORE the archive is marked downloaded. If generation throws, nothing is
 * marked, and the data stays exactly where it is.
 *
 * ?format=zip  (default) - all five formats in one zip
 * ?format=xlsx|csv|json|docx|pdf - a single file
