/**
 * GET /v1/cron/retention-purge
 *
 * cron-job.org, daily 03:30 IST (an hour after the scan):
 *   https://aaplisociety.vercel.app/v1/cron/retention-purge
 *   Header: Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
 *
 * ## The gate
 *
 * A document is deleted only when ALL SIX of these hold. Any one failing skips
 * the archive entirely and it is retried tomorrow.
 *
 *   1. RETENTION_PURGE_ENABLED is not "false"      — platform kill switch
 *   2. The society has `enabled: true`              — per-society opt-in
 *   3. The society opted in to THIS policy          — per-class opt-in
 *   4. The policy is `purgeable`                    — code-level veto
 *   5. archive.status === "downloaded"              — a human took a copy
 *   6. archive.downloadedAt is at least 1 hour old  — no same-minute races
 *
 * Note what is NOT in that list: "we sent an email". The old design purged
 * once an email had been *dispatched*, which proves nothing — the address
 * could be stale, the mail could bounce, it could sit in spam. Gating on
 * `downloadedAt` means the bytes provably reached a logged-in human before the
 * original was removed.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate: **if nobody ever downloads, nothing is ever
 * deleted.** The archives pile up as pending and the admin keeps getting
 * reminders. Unbounded growth is a far better failure mode than silent data
 * loss.
 *
 * ## Deletion is by pinned id, never by re-running the query
 *
 * We delete exactly `archive.docIds` — the set that was frozen at scan time
 * and that the admin actually received. Re-running "older than 60 days" at
 * purge time would match rows created after the scan, which the admin has
 * never seen a copy of.
