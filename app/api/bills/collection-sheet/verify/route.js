// app/api/bills/collection-sheet/verify/route.js
//
// Row-by-row validation for the Collections grid.
//
// This is the anti-tamper wall. The client sends ONLY:
//   { billId, amountPaid, mode, remarks, sig }
//
// It does not send billDue, openingDue, currentCharges or remainingDue. Those
// are re-read from the database here. The `sig` proves the numbers the admin
// was LOOKING AT when they typed still match the numbers in the database, so
// we can reject a stale sheet without trusting a single client-supplied figure.
//
// The five checks, in order:
//
//   1. SIGNATURE  - the locked columns were not edited in the browser, and the
//                   billing config has not changed since the sheet was built.
//   2. FRESHNESS  - the bill has not been paid by someone else since.
//   3. MODE GATE  - mode empty  => this row is a declaration of UNPAID.
//                   mode filled => this row is a declaration of PAID/PARTIAL.
//   4. RECONCILE  - what the admin declared must agree with what the member
//                   already did through the member app / payment gateway.
//   5. BOUNDS     - amountPaid is a real number, > 0 when a mode is given,
//                   and never more than what is actually outstanding.
//
// Nothing is written. This route is a pure validator; the grid calls it as
// many times as the admin wants. Committing is a separate explicit action.
