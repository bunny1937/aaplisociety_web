// app/admin/generate-bills/segments.js
//
// Segment configuration for the bill-generation wizard. Both Residential and
// Commercial render the SAME <BillGenerationFlow /> — the only difference is
// which config object it receives.
//
// CHANGED 2026-08-07 — the commercial segment no longer reads Members.
//
// It used to be:
//     membersUrl:  "/api/members/list"
//     memberFilter: (m) => ["Shop", "Office"].includes(m.flatType)
//
// which is the root of the whole A-103 mess: a flat had to be RE-LABELLED as a
// Shop to appear here, which destroyed its residential identity, and then it
// was billed twice — once in each series — off the same carpet area and the
// same opening balance.
//
// Commercial now reads the Shop collection, which is a separate record with its
// own area and its own ledger. A flat is never touched, never re-labelled, and
// never appears in both runs.
