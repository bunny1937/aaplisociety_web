// lib/commercial/headPresets.js
//
// NEW FILE.
//
// The old rate card started completely empty, so the admin's first job was to
// invent the names, calculation types and rates of every commercial head from
// scratch — which is exactly why the page felt unusable.
//
// These presets are the heads a Maharashtra co-operative housing society
// actually raises on a shop/office unit (MCS Act 1960 bye-law 68 heads, plus
// the commercial-only ones societies add in practice). One click seeds them,
// the admin then only edits AMOUNTS.
//
// Nothing here is charged until the admin sets an amount: every preset ships
// with a suggested rate that the admin must confirm, and a head with no rate
// for a unit class is skipped by the engine (with a visible warning).
