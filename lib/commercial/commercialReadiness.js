// REWRITTEN 2026-08-07 (v6).
//
// WHY: this file was the last place in the commercial module that still
// answered the question "what are my shops?" by reading
//
//     Member.find({ flatType: { $in: ["Shop", "Office"] } })
//
// That is the exact assumption the whole v6 rebuild removes. Shops are their
// own records now. Left as it was, the readiness strip above Generate Bills
// would have reported "0 shops" no matter how many shops you added, and would
// have kept telling you to go and re-label flats -- the very action that broke
// A-103 in the first place.
//
// Every message below is written for a non-technical society admin: what is
// wrong, why it matters to the bill, and the exact page to fix it on.
