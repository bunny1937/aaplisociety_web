/**
 * "You have an archive waiting" notifications.
 *
 * ## What changed (no more presigned R2 links)
 *
 * The first version uploaded a zip to R2 and emailed a presigned URL. That
 * meant: bytes stored for everyone whether or not they cared, a link that
 * expires and then generates a support ticket, and a URL that works for anyone
 * who gets forwarded the email — including after that person leaves the
 * managing committee.
 *
 * Now the email carries **no data and no link to data**. It carries a link to
 * the admin's own dashboard. They log in with their existing credentials and
 * download from there. Consequences:
 *
 *  - Nothing is stored anywhere. The bundle is built when the button is
 *    pressed and streamed straight to the browser.
 *  - Access is governed by your existing auth, live. A removed committee
 *    member loses access the moment their account is disabled, retroactively,
 *    for every archive.
 *  - The link never expires, so a two-week-old email still works.
 *  - Forwarding the email leaks nothing.
